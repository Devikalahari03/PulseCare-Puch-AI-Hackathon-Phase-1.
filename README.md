# PulseCare – AI-Powered Early Warning for Chronic Illnesses
*A Puch AI Hackathon – Phase 1 Submission*  

## Problem
Millions of people miss early signs of chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease because:
- Regular check-ups are expensive, time-consuming, or forgotten.
- Symptoms often appear late, making treatment harder and more costly.

By the time they realize something is wrong, it’s often too late for easy treatment.

## Solution – PulseCare
PulseCare is a **lightweight, AI-powered mobile health companion** that uses **Puch AI** to monitor key health parameters, detect early warning signs, and connect users to medical help before issues become serious.

### How It Works
1. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Integrates with wearables (smartwatch, fitness band, BP monitor) to track heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep, and activity.
   - Allows manual symptom logging.

2. **AI Risk Scoring (Powered by Puch AI)**  
   - Analyzes trends and patterns in health data.
   - Identifies anomalies and potential risk indicators for chronic diseases.

3. **Personalized Alerts**  
   - Sends easy-to-understand notifications like  
     *"Your weekly BP trend is rising – consider a check-up"*  
     instead of overwhelming medical jargon.

4. **Local Health Connect**  
   - Suggests nearby clinics, lab tests, or telehealth consultations when risk is detected.

5. **Privacy First**  
   - Health data stored locally or encrypted.
   - Full user control over sharing.

### Why People Will Use It
- Preventive care that fits into daily life.
- Gives **actionable insights**, not just numbers.
- Bridges the gap between fitness tracking and real healthcare.
- Can save lives through **early detection**.

### Example Scenario
Ravi, a 32-year-old IT professional, feels fine.  
PulseCare notices his resting heart rate and BP are trending upward over weeks.  
The app nudges him for a basic check-up – the doctor detects early-stage hypertension.  
Treatment begins early, preventing future complications.
